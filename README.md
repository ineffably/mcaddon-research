# mcaddon-research
Research notes for Minecraft Bedrock scripting and addons

## Gettings started

I'm doing this on a Windows 10 machine, so all the commands and steps are against that OS.
You should know how to use a command console on Windows. 

- Create your project folders

  Figure out the best place to keep your code on your system. I use a git folder where I store most of my code.  
  ```cd c:\git\ ```
  
  make a folder where you want to store your mcaddons  
  ```mkdir mcworld```

  I'm going to use ```c:\git\mcaddons``` for my addon root as a reference. 

- Download VSCode

  [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  
- Download Node
   
   [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- Install Yo
  
  In a dos terminal or your VSCode terminal..
  
  ```npm i -g yo```
 
  This will install a utility framework called `yo` globally so that we can use it to setup projects using the package from the next step.
 
- Install the addon generator

  Install the generator package that yo will utilze for generating our templates and help test deploy and package the addon. source: [generator-minecraft-addon](https://github.com/minecraft-addon-tools/generator-minecraft-addon)

  ```npm i -g generator-minecraft-addon```

  This will install the generator globally so that you can use it from any location.  
  From @AtomicBlom who also has some great sample projects...

- Create your addon project using the generator

  In a terminal:  
  ```yo minecraft-addon```

  follow the prompts (there is a wait)  
  ```
   PS K:\mcaddons> yo minecraft-addon

  ? What will be the name of your addon? demo-A
  ? What will your addon do or provide? Demonstration of creating an addon project
  ? What namespace will you use? demoa
  ? What kind of modules will make up the addon? Behaviors, Resources
  ? Will you be adding scripts? Yes
  ? What language do you want to script in? JavaScript
     create package.json
     create gulpfile.js
     create packs\resources\manifest.json
     create packs\resources\pack_icon.png
     create packs\behaviors\manifest.json
     create packs\behaviors\pack_icon.png
     create packs\behaviors\scripts\client\client.js
     create packs\behaviors\scripts\server\server.js

  I'm all done. Running npm install for you to install the required dependencies. If this fails, try running the command yourself.
  ```
  Above is an example of what it looks like, follow the prompts.

-  Open up your project folder
  
    This has created a project folder with commands already setup in the `package.json` file.
    Use VScode to open the folder the generator created. For more info on `package.json` lookup [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file).
    
    Here are the commands it generated for us: 
    ```
      "scripts": {
      "build": "gulp build",
      "watch": "gulp watch",
      "installaddon": "gulp install",
      "uninstalladdon": "gulp uninstall",
      "packageaddon": "gulp package"
    },
    ```
    
    - to install your addon use `gulp install` 
    - to just build your addon for validation `gulp build`
    - to package your addon for sharing `gulp package`

... next up investigating folders structures and some sample addons
